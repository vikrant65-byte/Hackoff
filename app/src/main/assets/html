    <b> Preheat oven to 450˚ Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl </b>
You may put the celery and peppers in the food processor if you don’t want chunks.
(I often use frozen bagged onions and peppers – thawed).
Mix all of the ingredients together with your hands.
Roll about a racquet ball size (or a little smaller) into your hand and place in a muffin tin sprayed with non-stick spray.
Bake for 20 minutes at 450˚. </p>
